# kilometre-counter

My dad who suffers from aphasia asked me to make him a program where he would simply enter the current kilometers his bike reads, and the program would then tell him how many kilometers he made that day. Like this he'd always know and not have to make -for him difficult- calculations in the head.

This could be solved easily with a simple Excel/Numbers sheet. But as I'm currently learning new web technologies, I "over-engineered" this task with a Vue.js app, which then connects to a database to store the information.

This repository is just in case someone is interested ðŸ™‚
